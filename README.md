Predicting Mental Health in New Zealand from Environmental Factors - A Group Project @ UC


Connections between environmental factors and mental health issues have been postulated in many different countries around the world. Previously undertaken
research has shown many possible connections between these fields, especially in relation to air quality and extreme weather events.

However, research on this subject is lacking in New Zealand, which is difficult to analyse as an overall nation due to its many micro-climates and regional differences.
Therefore, the aim of this project is to explore correlations between environmental factors and poor mental health outcomes in New Zealand by region and predict the number 
of people with mental health related illnesses corresponding to the environmental influence. 

This was accomplished through the use of several environmental and mental healthrelated data sets gathered from New Zealand government sources. 
A ridge regression analysis was carried out using R Studio, which showed correlations between air pollution levels and rainfall to mental health outcomes.

The selected envrionmental factors in this project are air quality (PM10), rainfall, temperature, and earthquake
